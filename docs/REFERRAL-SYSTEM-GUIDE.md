# üìö Complete Referral System Guide

## Overview
The referral system allows sellers/affiliates to promote the Master Course with personalized discount codes. Customers get discounts, and sellers earn commissions.

## üéØ How It Works

### For Administrators

#### 1. Creating a New Seller/Affiliate

Run the management script:
```bash
cd DayTradeDakApi
node scripts/manage-affiliates.js
```

Select option 1 and enter:
- **Affiliate Code**: Unique code (e.g., `MARIA2024`, `PEDRO15`)
- **Name**: Seller's full name
- **Email**: Seller's email
- **Phone**: Optional phone number
- **Discount %**: How much discount customers get (e.g., 10 for 10%)
- **Commission %**: How much commission seller earns (e.g., 5 for 5%)

#### 2. Important Values Explained

**Discount Percentage**
- This is what customers save
- Example: 10% = $300 off on $3,000 course
- Recommended: 10-20%

**Commission Rate**
- This is what seller earns from final price
- Example: 5% of $2,700 (after discount) = $135
- Recommended: 3-8%

#### 3. Managing Affiliates

Use the script menu to:
- **List all affiliates**: See all codes and their stats
- **View statistics**: Check specific seller performance
- **Toggle status**: Activate/deactivate codes
- **Update rates**: Change discount or commission
